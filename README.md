PCB for 32kHz Low power crystal oscillator using 74AUP logic.  Circuit from The Art of Electronics 3rd Edition, Section 7.1 figure 7-40.  
Note that I measured substantially higher current than H&H quoted: 867nA for 0.9V 1st stage, and 4.54uA for 1.8V *AUP1GU04* output driver.  I didn't have any AUP1G04 lying around.  Measured with a Keysight B2901A SMU.
